    <p class="text-left">
        Since 1994 when we first began manufacturing our own line of outdoor furniture,
         our mission to create beautiful & functional designs from recycled plastic has steadily increased in scope. 
         What began as a small family operation has since expanded to include sales all over the world. We feel that using unwanted 
         plastic that would otherwise be destined for a land fill site is important to ourselves and others' peace of mind.
          By purchasing recycled products we all keep the wheel turning.
         New products made from recycled materials are a sustainable method of conserving finite resources.

        Commitment to Quality Our furniture is not the lightweight injection-moulded stacking chairs that you'll typically find on most decks and patios. 
        Our products are built from solid "plastic lumber" and hand-crafted in much the same way as the classic wood designs they faithfully replicate. 
        The end benefit is that our furniture is extremely comfortable, durable, and maintenance free while retaining the charm & quality of the original.
         We call our line of products "The Generation Line. "The extended lifespan of our outdoor products ensures that the next generation or two from your 
         family will also enjoy the benefits of our Generation Line's timeless classic designs, durable construction and comfort for many, many years to come. 
         Even though our Generation Line of Furniture appears to be an overnight sensation it has been in development for more than 15 years. 
         Our Generation Line of furniture has the heft, look and warmth of wood without succumbing to the shortcomings of wood. No rot, mildew, mould, splitting, 
         cracking, painting or staining to worry about. As an added benefit, your purchases help divert used plastics from landfills, and prevent the unnecessary
          felling of trees. Enjoy Canadian Recycled Plastic Products is committed to quality and to our environment. 
        We know that you will enjoy your Generation Line furniture for many, many years to come.
        <br style="margin:0">Enjoy!
